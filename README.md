# Description
This library is designed for marshaling and unmarshalling protobufs in a *dynamic* way.
This means you don't need to compile .proto files.

Since we are marshalling and unmarshalling Protobuf messages in a dynamic way,
the project is called *dproto*.

# Status
Encoding and Decoding messages works
